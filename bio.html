<h1 class="title">About</h1>

<p class="entry">Hey! My name is Gabe Jacobs. I am a senior studying Computer Science at Tufts University. I love working on creative projects, whether it has to do with Tech, Music, or Film. Whatever I am doing, I try hard to give it my all and come out with something I am proud of.<br><br>I started doing iOS development when I was 14 years old. It quickly became a passion of mine. Since then, I have worked on some really cool projects and with some really  talented people. I had the pleasure to work at <a href="https://groupme.com/">GroupMe</a> (Skype), as well as start a few of my own apps with some great teams at Tufts. I hope to continue my passion for iOS development outside of college and into the real world. There is nothing better than having something you created in the pockets of people all around the world.<br><br>Outside of tech, I love music and film. I once wrote on a music blog called <a href="http://lowerfrequencies.com/">Lower Frequencies</a> and also created many video projects during High School and College. If I could find a way to combine my interests in tech and film, it would be a dream come true.</p>
