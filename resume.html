	<p class="entry">KanyeZone is the iOS version of the extremely popular <a href="http://www.kanyezone.com/">web game</a>. The goal of the game is to keep Kanye out of his zone by blocking him with your ball. Each block gains you $50K closer to your high score. It's fun, addicting, and totally outrageous. Unfortunately, copyright issues has delayed the release of the game. </p>

	alongside some unbelievably talented developers. During my time there I 
	worked on numerous bug fixes and features for the iOS app. I also 
	implemented inline media content and helped prepare version 5.0 for 
	release.</p>
