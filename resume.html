	<h1 class="title">Kanye Zone</h1>
	
	<p class="entry">KanyeZone is the iOS version of the extremely popular <a href="http://www.kanyezone.com/">web game</a>. The goal of the game is to keep Kanye out of his zone by blocking him with your ball. Each block gains you $50K closer to your high score. It's fun, addicting, and totally outrageous. Unfortunately, copyright issues has delayed the release of the game. </p>

	<p class="entry">I worked at <a href="https://groupme.com/">GroupMe</a> (Skype) during the summers of 2013 and 2014 
	alongside some unbelievably talented developers. During my time there I 
	worked on numerous bug fixes and features for the iOS app. I also 
	implemented inline media content and helped prepare version 5.0 for 
	release.</p>

	<h1 class="title">Marko</h1>
	
	<p class="entry">Marko is a social networking, location based iPhone app that I created 
	with a small team during my junior year at Tufts University. The idea was to lock content to the location they were created. That way, users can access the content if they themselves are located at this location. It brings the expression, "You had to be there" to life. The app is currently available on the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/marko/id750824884?mt=8">App Store.</a></p>

	<h1 class="title">Gabe Jacobs Productions</h1>
	
	<p class="entry">In the early days of the App Store, I created over 20 different iPhone/iPad apps sold under the name Gabe Jacobs Productions. This included lots of silly applications such as <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fart-for-free/id300897713?mt=8">Fart For Free</a> which topped the charts of free iPhone Apps. I also partnered with the rapper/artist Lil Jon and created his <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lil-jon-official-soundboard/id329941431?mt=8">official soundboard</a>.</p>
